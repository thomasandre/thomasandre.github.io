<p>This summer, I participated in the 8th edition of the Global Trajectory Optimisation Competition (GTOC 8).  GTOC is a competition where <em>"the best aerospace engineers and mathematicians world wide challenge themselves to solve as 'nearly impossible' problem of interplanetary trajectory design"</em>
 
This year's theme was "High resolution mapping of radio souces in the universe using space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)"  </p>

<p>The other teams were composed of seasoned industry professionals with advanced degrees and university researchers. I completed this on my own, following my first full year as an undergraduate student. Some teams had more than ten members. </p>

<ul>
<li>Integrated with PyKEP, an open source scientific library for astrodynamics research. Code found 
## OpenRocket-ActEC (Active Energy Control)
<a href="https://github.com/ChrisAndre/OR-ActEC">Code found here</a> 
This is a testbed for high-powered rocket flight computers that control active energy elements during the boost/coast phase of a rocket. Derivative work of the open source OpenRocket and Dispersion software projects.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>ActEC is intended to torture test candidate control algorithms. It exploits the medium-fidelity flight simulation capabilities of OpenRocket to provide a realistic environment against which a candidate controller can be tested.  </p>

<p>ActEC emulates onboard electronic sensors that can provide input to a controller. Their dynamics can be 'fuzzed' such that their outputs are distorted to emulate real-world noise and other imperfections. The flight conditions (including air temperate, density, etc.) as well as the physical properties/functionalities of the rocket and its control system can be 'fuzzed' to model inherent imperfections in real-world measurements.  ActEC provides immediate, realistic controller performance feedback that can augment/replace real test flight data.</p>

<ul>
<li>PyKEP is an open source scientific library originally written by the European Space Agency (ESA) that provides basic tools to perform research in interplanetary trajectory design.</li>
<li>PaGMO (Parallel Global Multi-objective Optimizer) – also written at ESA – provides access to a global and local optimization algorithms and problems. It’s main purpose is to perform parallel computations of optimization tasks (global and local) via the asynchronous generalized island model.</li>
