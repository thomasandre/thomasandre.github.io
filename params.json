GTOC is a competition where _\"the best aerospace engineers and mathematicians world wide challenge themselves to solve as 'nearly impossible' problem of interplanetary trajectory design\"_\r\n \r\nThis year's theme was \"High resolution mapping of radio souces in the universe using space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)\"  \r\n\r\nThe other teams were composed of seasoned industry professionals with advanced degrees and university researchers. I completed this on my own, following my first full year as an undergraduate student. Some teams had more than ten members. \r\n\r\n# My Coding Projects\r\n## Demonstration Python Code for Exponential Sinusoid Trajectories\r\n* Integrated with PyKEP, an open source scientific library for astrodynamics research. Code found \r\n## OpenRocket-ActEC (Active Energy Control)\r\n[Code found here](https://github.com/ChrisAndre/OR-ActEC) \r\nThis is a testbed for high-powered rocket flight computers that control active energy elements during the boost/coast phase of a rocket. Derivative work of the open source OpenRocket and Dispersion software projects.  \r\n\r\nActEC is intended to torture test candidate control algorithms. It exploits the medium-fidelity flight simulation capabilities of OpenRocket to provide a realistic environment against which a candidate controller can be tested.  \r\n\r\nActEC emulates onboard electronic sensors that can provide input to a controller. Their dynamics can be 'fuzzed' such that their outputs are distorted to emulate real-world noise and other imperfections. The flight conditions (including air temperate, density, etc.) as well as the physical properties/functionalities of the rocket and its control system can be 'fuzzed' to model inherent imperfections in real-world measurements.  ActEC provides immediate, realistic controller performance feedback that can augment/replace real test flight data.\r\n## Enhancements and bug fixes for ESA/PyKEP and ESA/PaGMO\r\n* PyKEP is an open source scientific library originally written by the European Space Agency (ESA) that provides basic tools to perform research in interplanetary trajectory design.\r\n* PaGMO (Parallel Global Multi-objective Optimizer) – also written at ESA – provides access to a global and local optimization algorithms and problems. It’s main purpose is to perform parallel computations of optimization tasks (global and local) via the asynchronous generalized island model.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
